# JFX-Examples-mannewil
This is a repo containing various javafx programs I've made, for the following reasons:
1) To prepare for an exam.
2) To prepare for the pre-exam.
3) To self-study (probably the lesser reason, since javafx isn't used anywhere these days, discounting purists x_x)
4) To learn and understand functionality of this library.

The code is probably not perfect at all, and it's probably useless. If anything, at least I can link this repo to people who need help with it. Hoorah.
